# Airplane Crashes and Fatality since 1908
Cleaning and analysing Airplane crashes and deriving insights using Microsoft Excel and Microsoft PowerBI

# Introduction
This project is the capstone Project of the #30dayslearning. I had previousy worked on an Airpalne Satisfaction report,hence i decided to work on this project also.
This documentation includes :
    
      .Data Preparation
      .Data Analysis
      .Visualization
# Data Preparation
Did a run through of the dataset; first I had to go read about the aviation industry to gain domain knowledge. Then went ahead to Excel

Using Excel started with data cleaning ,ensuring that it is correct, relevant, complete free of error and outlier when performing analysis :

    .Explore and observe data
    .Checked for duplicates.
    .Changed each column to the appropriate data type.

I knew weather condition is a factor for airplane crashes; I needed to extract the word “weather’’ or any word related to it.
Used the find and replace function in the summary column to replace words like “rain”, “storm”, ‘hail”, ‘thunderstorm’, ‘ice’ or words associated with weather etc.
Then i used the excel function below to extract ‘Weather ”
    * nffjejfj
    * the data
